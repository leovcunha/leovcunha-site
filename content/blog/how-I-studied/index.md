description: "How I studied programming and computer science curricula to become a software engineer"
---

In 2015, I started studying to become a software engineer. I just had my little daughter, so I tried to take a softer route. I did a postgraduate specialization in Brazil which covered basic subjects of computer science. Some courses that were handed out: computer organization, algorithms, java programming, software design, networks and databases. Meanwhile, I took HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS lessons on Codecademy. I finished this first part of my journey in May 2016. It was very introductory, and I didn't get the level of knowledge and practice I wished.

Then I designed the curriculum I wanted to go through using course materials available online from top USA institutions. I put to myself a deadline to finish it in 18 months. Today there are some excellent resources available online, more optimized. The one I like the most and recommend is my friend [P1xt's Guides](https://github.com/p1xt/p1xt-guides).

Hereâ€™s the road I took:

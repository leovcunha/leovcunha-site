I just had my little daughter, so I tried to take a softer route. I did a postgraduate specialization in Brazil which covered basic subjects of computer science. Some courses that were handed out: computer organization, algorithms, java programming, software design, networks and databases. Meanwhile, I took HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS lessons on Codecademy. I finished this first part of my journey in May 2016. It was very introductory, and I didn’t get the level of knowledge and practice I wished.</p>\n<p>Then I designed the curriculum I wanted to go through using course materials available online from top USA institutions. I put to myself a deadline to finish it in 18 months. Today there are some excellent resources available online, more optimized. The one I like the most and recommend is my friend <a href=\"https://github.com/p1xt/p1xt-guides\">P1xt’s Guides</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s the road I took:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Subject</th>\n<th>Coursework</th>\n<th>Book used</th>\n<th>Project done</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Months 1-2</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Math for Computer Science</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/\">MIT 6.001</a></td>\n<td>Course notes</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Computer Organization and Design</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://nand2tetris.org\">Nand2Tetris</a></td>\n<td>Elements of Computing Systems: Build a computer from first principles</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Months 3-4</strong></td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://cs61a.org\">Berkeley CS61a</a></td>\n<td>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Algorithms and Data Structures</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1\">Coursera/Princeton</a></td>\n<td>Algorithms (Sedgewick and Wayne)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Months 5-6</strong></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Programming Languages</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages\">Univ.
